I was just reading the <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">IEEE</span> [Spectrum](http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/nov06/inthisissue) and it was the first time that I <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">paied</span> attention to the recruiting advertisements of the companies in the United States. Here are some texts cited from it.

 <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and Carnegie Mellon University is required not to discriminate in admission, employment or ad</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">ministration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex or handicap.</span>

 <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Smiths Aerospace is an Equal Opportunity Employer promoting diversity in the workplace. We invite and encourage response from women, persons of color, veterans and disabled.</span>

 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">An Equal Opportunity Employer.<br /> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br /> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br /> I had some experiences in finding a job in China, even when you want to enter the top companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, as well as P&#038;G, Goldman Sachs, GE, or you just want to be admitted by top universities like Peking University, usually you can feel some kinds of discrimination:</p> 

<p>
  </span><span style="font-size:130%;"></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1.</span> You need fill a form about your national region(In China we usually call that &#8220;<span id="misp_compose_1" class="hm">Hukou</span>&#8220;) when you apply a position in IBM, P&#038;G, etc(<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">I can not find the page because you can&#8217;t access it before entering the online apply system</span>). Usually when you want to be a clack of local government agency, it <a href="http://www.offcn.com/Html/Place/shzl/44_876.html">requires a local <span id="misp_compose_2" class="hm">Hukou</span></a>(the current-year collage students can also be admitted, but it is indeed a lie, quite few student can get the opportunity. Additionally, it is only a superficial policy to solve the unemployment of college students in China), which can not make sense! Why a person born in the West can not serve as a clack in the government of East? It is a whole country, not a United Provinces. The discrimination upon national region is especially obvious in China. People live in the big cities look down upon people live in small cities; but people live in small cities look down upon peasants. <span id="misp_compose_3" class="hm">Shanghanees</span> usually look down upon people from other provinces except Beijing; all the people around China look down upon people from <span id="misp_compose_4" class="hm">Henan</span> Province. What&#8217;s wrong with China?
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(255, 153, 0);">2.</span> A lot of companies do not want to hire unmarried female employee, as they usually will get married and probably would quit from current job. HR will ask every question about your personal affair including the question like &#8220;If your husband want you to quit from job, what will you do? or Do you have a boy/girlfriend in a different city?&#8221;(cited from <a href="http://fibonecei.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%2148DD04065BFBD4DE%212185.entry">here</a>). If P&#038;G ask me the same question in the United States, I will argue for the discrimination and refuse to answer such silly questions? It is totally personal affair and you have no right to know this. (Well, I shall not apply P&G after graduate study.) The question is: they ask the question in China!
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">3. </span>The person with disability even can not enter the university. We have the <a href="http://www.chinaedunet.com/news/zhuanti/2006/5/content_44722.shtml">example</a> in China.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">4. </span>You must speak fluent English, even you can speak Chinese well and you will never speak English during the whole career, a high level of English ability is required and there is a discrimination upon the English ability. (Every Chinese know this. Even you study traditional Chinese culture or Arts, you need to learn English. What&#8217;s wrong with our country?)
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">5.</span> You must be in a Top 5 university, otherwise Peking University, GS, Google and Microsoft probably would not admit you despite of your distinguished ability. They usually do not give the opportunity to the other universities except top 5. Let&#8217;s take Peking University for example, when I was taking the graduate entrance interview in <span id="misp_compose_5" class="hm">PKU</span>, a guy from another university (maybe from <span id="misp_compose_6" class="hm">Geoscience</span> University) also got the opportunity to have the interview, but the committee said that you were not from the top 5 university and your undergraduate major was <span id="misp_compose_7" class="hm">Geoscience</span>, why you came here to study Computer Science and <span id="misp_compose_8" class="hm">Bioinfomatics</span>?. Well, even though I came from a top 5 university, they asked me about the occupation of my parents, my family financial status.(You know, we have full scholarship, the family financial status is not a factor in admission.), and why did you come to <span id="misp_compose_9" class="hm">PKU</span> to study CS and <span id="misp_compose_10" class="hm">Bioinfo</span> as your undergraduate major was Math. <span id="misp_compose_11" class="hm">OMG</span>, why can&#8217;t? Well, I must admit that Peking University is the best university that emphasis the diversity of students among all the universities around China. Usually the worse the university is, the more <span id="misp_compose_12" class="hm">emphsis</span> putted on the rank of your original university or the silly GPA despite of your ability. GS, Google, Microsoft and IBM even do not post any campus recruiting advertisements in the universities other than top 5. Why? I know that they want to recruit excellent person, but a top 5 ranking equals to excellent ability and vice <span id="misp_compose_13" class="hm">versa</span>? Well, do not say that I am a cynicism. I finally got the offer from Microsoft, passed the final round of Google and got the admission of Peking University. I just want to show my opinion on the discrimination.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">6. </span>If you do not have a straight sexual orientation in China, well, it&#8217;s too dangerous. Tomatoes , eggs and words can drown you to the hell, you&#8217;d better do you best to come to the United States. (And do not forget to mention the reason when you are applying your visa)
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">7. </span>In China, a lot of people are infected by a strange virus called <span id="misp_compose_15" class="hm">HBV</span>. Usually <span id="misp_compose_16" class="hm">HBV</span> is not dangerous and will not affect others during daily activities like <span id="misp_compose_17" class="hm">huging</span>, shacking hands and having dinner together. However, a lot of companies like <span id="misp_compose_18" class="hm">Huawai</span> (<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">its biz scope is about telecommunication, I refuse to link it</span>) refuse to hire employees with <span id="misp_compose_19" class="hm">HBV</span>. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);" id="misp_compose_20" class="hm">Huawei</span><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"> is really suck.</span> (You know, it just <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/30/content_353070.htm">copy a lot</a> from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cisco,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> we know that.)</p> 
  
  <p>
    In one word, although we all know that discrimination is everywhere in the world including United States, to be honest, I must concede that </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the discrimination in China is really quite quite serious.</span>
