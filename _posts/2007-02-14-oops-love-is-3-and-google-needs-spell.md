If you type <3 in Gmail talk (Note: Not the gtalk client or any jabber client), you will get a gif.
  
Take a look at  [this](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/gmail-hearts-you.html) and [this](https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=34056).

Well, no wonder! Love is really the thing needs <3 people :)
  
BTW, this is Google&#8217;s LOGO today:

Is it Google or Googe? Well, the [romantic version](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/strawberries-are-red-stems-are-green.html) is: g and l are falling in love. Or, you can not spell &#8220;girl&#8221; without g and l, they are together! ([Chinese Version](http://googlechinablog.com/2007/02/1-gmail.html))

The XXX version is, they are 69ing. (Oh dude, I just cite the comments from Digg)

// BTW, The Internet is a series of tubes, not pipes. So enjoy YouTube and no bother Yahoo! Pipe. LOL!
