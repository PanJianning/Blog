En, I am sorry, it seems that you are probably not going to vote:)
  
It is election day, why not go and vote :)
  
I am not the citizen of the United States, so I just stay at home and write this post.

恩，假如你身在美国并且是今天读到这个帖子，看上去你今天没去为选举投票。
  
今天是美国中期选举日，主要选出各级议员，为明年／后年的总统选举做准备

哈哈，俺们不是美国公民，幸灾乐祸在家看美国人忙着选举，我就写Blog提醒他们去选举吧。
