I was talking to a geeky American girl via AIM.

> Me: I once asked the God to offer me a girl.
  
> She: Offer: command not found.
  
> Me: sudo offer me a girl.
  
> She: Password:_
  
> Me: shutdown -h now.

Later&#8230;

> She: Wanna catch a movie? 2:00pm &#8211; 4:00pm, &#8220;3:10 to Yuma&#8221;.
  
> Me: Nice, but I have an appointment at 3:00, no time slot available&#8230;
  
> She: Freaking stupid segmentation fault. How can you have an appointment at 3:00pm?
  
> Me: Nice equivoque. I should kill dash nine my cron

Finally

> Me: It&#8217;s raining cats and dogs outside, any luck to stop it?
  
> She: We are raining dinosaurs here. They should be dead million years ago.
  
> Me: So, do you want to go out and kill them? you are not an environmentalist, right?
  
> She: No, just beam them up.
  
> Me: Captain Scotty is absent.
  
> She: LOL, KTHXBYE.
