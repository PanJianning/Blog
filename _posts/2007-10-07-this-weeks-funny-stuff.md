(With a friend, walking on the street)
  
She: Why are you walking so fast, are Chinese people usually walking so fast? Why?
  
I:      Because we don&#8217;t have a car.

(On a birthday party with an American friend)
  
He: Nice party, huh?
  
I:    It&#8217;s really nice &#8212; my first birthday party in US, actually.
  
He: Do people in China usually have birthday parties?
  
I:     Not too many, once a year.
  
He:  &#8230;&#8230; LOL&#8230;&#8230;..

(In a restaurant, with a friend)
  
He: How&#8217;s the food?
  
I:     It&#8217;s good, but you know what, I will take it home.
  
He: Why?
  
I:     I am gonna do some reverse engineering and figure out how to cook that.
  
He:  Emmm, well. (turn to the waiter). What&#8217;s the Term of Use of this dish?
  
(All people in that restaurant looked at us, as we were not from this planet)
