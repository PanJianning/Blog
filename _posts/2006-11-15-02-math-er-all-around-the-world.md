These days I am trying to collect the contact information of my classmates in north america, <span style="color: #cc0000">I&#8217;ve almost finished the work.</span> Yesterday I just came across the &#8220;world.dem&#8221; file in the demo of GNUplot, an idea suddenly struck me: <span style="color: #993300">why not plot the position of all the classmates by simply changing the data file. Em, it sounds good.</span>

It is not hard to find the corresponding longitude and latitude of some universities with powerful <span style="color: #000099">Google Maps</span>. En, this is the byproduct and <span style="font-style: italic"></span><span style="color: #006600">I am now quite proud of it.</span> Maybe I can collect the contact information of all the classmates and title the graph as &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000">O2 Math-er, all around the world</span>&#8221; :)

OK, I will do this later, do not worry about that.

To my classmates: I will mail you the contact list soon. :)
