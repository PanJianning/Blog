Sometimes you are viewing the conversation in Gmail while just a new mail is coming. Maybe you will find that the number of unread mails in the Inbox is updated. However, maybe it is my carelessness, I haven&#8217;t noticed the image below before. Is is a new feature of Gmail? It is easy to implement but very convenient to the user.

It appears on the right-bottom side of my Gmail windows. (I am using MacOS + Firefox)
