[In response to [this](http://niniane.blogspot.com/2006/07/why-i-dont-date-asian-men.html). Satire, proceed with caution]

**I am a loser in color**

Yes, I am a loser, by all means. In the first place, I am not white, and this kills me. As I&#8217;ve said, I am a loser. According to the definition of loser in Asian girls&#8217; dictionaries, if you are not white, you&#8217;ve already been punished by \___ (fill this blank with Buddha, Jesus Christ, OMG, [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://www.venganza.org/), etc., as long as you believe them) because you are a loser. So, you see, I am a loser in religionary view.

I am a loser in the real world**

But that is not the end. I am also a loser in the real world. As a research assistant, I get about 1.7k bucks per month, which is slightly better than working at Wal*Mart. I don&#8217;t have a car; I ride my skateboard or scooter to school everyday because gas is expensive. I live in an apartment with one roommate but no pets. I am not working at Google or Microsoft for 100k+ per year because I withdrew their offers. The best company I&#8217;ve ever worked in is SIEMENS&#8211;a stupid German company, as an intern. I am a Ph.D. student of Washington University, which is far worse than Harvard, Yale, Stanford or MIT. Asian girls won&#8217;t like me at this point for my Forrest Gump&#8217;s IQ or even can&#8217;t enter a university better than George W. Bush.

I am a loser in bodybuilding**

I am 5&#8217;7, while all white guys here, according to Asian girls&#8217; descriptions, are 6&#8217;+. Milk with Calcium and Vitamin D turns out to be not so that helpful. According to Asian girls research data, all white dudes here have &#8220;hard drivers&#8221; larger than 200GB, while I was cheated by Bill Gates and thought 640k is enough. The white dudes obviously are running Linux with a quite long uptime, while my PC (personal something) has to reboot every 30 minutes maybe. I am a loser in bodybuilding.

**I am a loser in language**

It&#8217;s definitely true. I know tons of Tang Poetry, but it&#8217;s out-of-date. The only language, which can be used to date Asian girls, is English. As you can see, &#8220;vous Ãªtes belle!&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work for Asian girls. Sometimes you call them and say HAI, I CAN HAZ A DATE WITH YOU? KTHBYE. And they will point out your grammatical error. Asian girls are all kindly teachers and a grammar error will totally ruin your date. I have to admit that my English ARE BELONGS to inferiority and am afraid to give them a call with my poor English. While I am officially a loser in language, Asian girls also have more than one million choices available, which are of course, US men from 18 to 80. This won&#8217;t change until I get a green card, which states I am a permanent resident, and therefore certifies I am not a loser in language anymore.

I am a loser in bridging the culture gap**

Wait, do I really have culture gaps with Asian girls? Yes, I do. There is a saying: When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Here we have to replace Rome to America. Therefore, I have to act as American. I am a Pastafarian, read [LOLcat bible](http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Main_Page), while general American is Christian and read Holy Bible. I am family-centric and Americans prefer NSA (w/wo condom). I hang on digg/slashdot everyday (yes, I am a geek) while Americans have party everyday. Asian girls, in the other hand, expect their significant others, to be conservative American style. I am liberal and will definitely go to hell after death, and I know I can&#8217;t bridge the culture gap.

In conclusion, I am a loser in everything. Now you can see the reasons why Asian girls don&#8217;t like me. Asian girls, &#8220;leave me alone&#8221; :)
