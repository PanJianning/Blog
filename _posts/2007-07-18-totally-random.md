In a Linux shell with GNU make:

>make love
  
make: \*** No rule to make target &#8216;love&#8217;. Stop

Do you really get tired of this line? Try this:

>vim makefile

love: @ echo &#8220;oh, yeah, oh oh oh yea, yes, yes, yes.&#8221;

> make love

oh, yeah, oh oh oh yea, yes, yes, yes.

Em, literally &#8216;sounds&#8217; better. BTW, if you are using a Mac. try to pipe this to &#8220;say&#8221;, which is the command line interface of the **embedded Text-to-Speech engine**. Well, awesome!

Another one from [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/c149.html):

Any new idea to make fun with Linux?
