A short while after I posted &#8220;<a href="http://blog.youxu.info/2007/10/15/why-asian-girl-in-us-doesnt-want-to-date-me/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to Why Asian girl in US doesn’t want to date me">Why Asian girl in US doesn’t want to date me </a>&#8220;, <a href="http://niniane.blogspot.com/" rel="external nofollow">Niniane</a> visited my blog and  [said,](http://blog.youxu.info/2007/10/15/why-asian-girl-in-us-doesnt-want-to-date-me/#comment-2207) ·

> This was pretty funny. If you are a slashdot/digg geek, shouldn’t you be running linux? Instead of a PC with 640k memory.
  
> I must agree that LOLcats would not work on girls. The grammar is not funny! You should instead use AllYourBase.&#8221;

First, thank Niniane for visiting and leaving **very helpful** suggestions. According to her suggestions, I refined some sentences here:

I am running Debian sid (unstable) on my grandma&#8217;s Pentium 66MHz + 128M which is buggy so I have to reboot X after 30 minutes, while they are running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Long Time Support) on Core Duo + 4GB.

And next time if I want to date an Asian girl, I should say:

> How are you young lady!!
  
>  [All your base are belong to me.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us)
  
> You are on the way to our dating.

I guess it works, at least for Niniane. LOL.
