I highlighted some important items that might be useful for our Chinese students.<font style="color: #000000" size="4"><br /> </font><font size="2"><br /> >General information to include</font>

To make it easier for us to determine where you might best fit within our organization we ask that you take a few simple steps to help us understand your qualifications. Following the guidelines below will ensure your resume/CV finds its way to the appropriate group more quickly, giving you a better opportunity to discuss your qualifications in person or via a phone screen.

* All resumes/CVs and supporting materials <span style="font-weight: bold">must be submitted electronically</span>; no paper resumes will be accepted.
  
* PDF, HTML, or Microsoft Word documents or text formats are acceptable – or you can submit using plain text format.
  
* All resumes and related materials (transcripts, etc.) should be submitted in English.
  
* <span style="font-weight: bold">Pictures, images, or other graphics are not necessary</span> – and are discouraged as they can slow evaluations.
  
* Only send essential personal information – be sure to include your name and how to contact you in the resume, not just your cover letter. Include your email, phone, and residence address.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Do NOT include your gender, date of birth, age, family status, or personal identification numbers.</span>
  
* It isn&#8217;t necessary to include military service you may have performed, unless it reflects some special achievements or accomplishments that you feel illustrate your qualifications for the job.
  
* To increase the accuracy of the information we have about you and the speed with which we&#8217;re able to reply to your submission, please keep your resume clean and simple. <span style="font-weight: bold">The use of special formatting, tables, images, multiple columns, etc., can decrease the ability to accurately review resumes. As we&#8217;ve found with Google itself, plain text works best! </span>

>Submitting a resume – Educational background

Your resume/CV should reflect your academic achievements and accomplishments in these areas. In the education section of your resume, be sure to include the information outlined below.

* Your resume should show all post-secondary institutions attended, degrees conferred, and a <span style="font-weight: bold">cumulative grade point average</span> (if available) for each degree received.
  
* Only report your educational history dating back to the university level; do NOT include elementary or secondary schooling. However, if you completed a &#8220;year abroad&#8221; program as part of your pre-university education, feel free to include this in your resume.
  
* Provide a brief description of any important projects you completed as part of your coursework, and indicate whether it was all your work or done as part of a team. <span style="font-weight: bold">If part of a team, indicate your own role and contributions to the effort. </span>
  
* If you graduated from a university within the last five years, <span style="font-weight: bold">include a copy of your transcripts (unofficial is okay)</span>, a list showing individual coursework completed and grades received, as well as the overall grade average.

>Submitting a resume – Your Work Experience

You may be fresh out of a university, or have substantial work experience and a history of accomplishments. Either way, we want to know what skills you&#8217;ve acquired along the way. We&#8217;ll look closely at the work experience section of your resume, so the information you provide here is very important. Please follow the guidelines below carefully.

* List your experience – projects completed, accomplishments, etc. – by your position with each employer.
  
* <span style="font-weight: bold">Include more information than just the name of your employer and your job title. </span> We also want to see concise, yet important, detail on your specific accomplishments and <span style="font-weight: bold">the impact your efforts had</span> on your company.
  
* Rather than including all job responsibilities, <span style="font-weight: bold">only focus on those that you feel are relevant to the job</span> for which you are applying at Google.
  
* <span style="font-weight: bold">If you worked while attending a university, either during the summer or concurrent with your course work, be sure to include a brief mention </span> even if it isn&#8217;t specifically related to a potential job at Google.

>Submitting a resume – Additional Information

Here at Google, we value talent and intelligence, group spirit and diversity, creativity and idealism. <span style="font-weight: bold">Googlers range from former neurosurgeons and puzzle champions to alligator wrestlers and Lego maniacs</span>. Tell us what makes you unique!

* Include the names and contact information of 2-3 references. These can include faculty advisors, co-workers, managers, or others who can talk knowledgeably about your skills and abilities
  
* <span style="font-weight: bold">Be sure to include any awards you&#8217;ve received, articles you&#8217;ve published, or conference presentations you&#8217;ve given.</span>
  
* We don&#8217;t need to see copies of any awards or publications, just a reference to them.
  
* We don&#8217;t need copies of any written references you already have, just a mention of 2-3 individuals that can reflect on your most recent skills and experiences. Be sure to include their contact information. We will not contact your references until after we talk to you.

> What to expect from your interview

* While we&#8217;ll certainly do our best to make you feel comfortable during the interview process, we&#8217;re very interested in learning more about  <span style="font-weight: bold">how you approach problem-solving.</span> The questions you&#8217;ll be asked will be in-depth and will be intended to let us get a peek at how you think about complicated things. Many candidates find this challenging, but ultimately exhilarating. It&#8217;s your chance to show an appreciative audience exactly how much you&#8217;ve learned about your area of expertise.
  
* Interviews are always conducted in English and you should have a strong command of the language so you&#8217;ll be able to describe your ideas clearly. This is essential as all positions interact directly with engineers in the U.S. and other countries.
  
* Google&#8217;s phone screen and in-person interviews are highly technical in nature. <span style="font-weight: bold">You&#8217;ll be asked to write code during the interview itself and to speak to the technical details of your past designs and implementations </span>. You should expect that your interviewers will have a great deal of curiosity about the specifics of your work and <span style="font-weight: bold">will ask questions about how you arrived at your conclusions</span>. Our engineers admire and respect the work of others and are truly interested in learning more about what you&#8217;ve accomplished and how you did it.
